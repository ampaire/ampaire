I am Phemia Ampaire, a Full-Stack Developer. I love challenging myself to be a better person every day. I have contributed to open-source projects and helped mentor many developers. My greatest joy is sharing what I have learned each day.

I am currently working as a Product Validation Engineer at Cadence Design Systems where I started as an intern in 2021. During my free time, I tutor Web Development at CareerFoundry.
